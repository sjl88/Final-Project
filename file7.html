<!--Looks like you're ready to get going on your webpage. Good luck. Let's remember a few basic things.

1. If you haven't worked through one of our Open Fuego introductory assignmnets (Electrate Fuego or I-Am-A-Project-In-Becoming), please do so. It will give you the basic skills to use this tool.
2. File Management. Keep your asset names simple and one word.
3. Make sure your assets names/file type match your code.
4. Describe all images for accesibility purposes.
5. Consult W3 when our code is not working for you.
6. Control Z, Control Z, Control Z
7. Publish, share, spread the Fuego!-->

              <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white; font-size:2.1em">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

              <h2 style="text-align:left; color:white">What about humane/sustainable meat?</h2>
              <p style="text-align:left; color:white">Local, free-range meat is an improvement over factory farming. However, we can’t possibly raise 9 billion animals “sustainably.” If we’re truly going to switch to a more sustainable food system, everyone needs to drastically reduce the amount of animal products they consume, even if they’re coming from smaller, more local production facilities.</p>

              <h2 style="text-align:left; color:white">But meat tastes too good to go plant-based?</h2>
              <p style="text-align:left; color:white">You don't have to give up the tastes and textures you love in order to become a vegetarian. There are now products like Gardein and Beyond Meat that fool chefs in taste tests. And even if you really don't think you can give up meat completely, you can still make changes. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. More and more Americans are becoming “flexitarians.” Participating in Meatless Mondays, using soy crumbles instead of ground beef in tacos or chili, getting Trader Joe's Meatless Meatballs, switching from cow milk to almond milk... all of those choices make a big difference, even if you're not 100% vegetarian or vegan.</p>

              <h2 style="text-align:left; color:white">How do you get protein on a plant-based diet?</h2>
              <p style="text-align:left; color:white">Beans, lentils, whole grains, soy, nuts. People need about 50g of protein a day, which if you’re eating a healthy, varied diet isn’t hard to do. Most Americans eat twice as much protein as they’re supposed to, which causes its own health problems. You're probably already eating plant-based proteins without thinking about it. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, falafels, and veggie burritos with beans and rice are all complete proteins.</p>

              <h2 style="text-align:left; color:white">Don't we need calcium for healthy bones?</h2>
              <p style="text-align:left; color:white">Dark leafy greens like kale have lots of calcium, as do some other foods like walnuts. Most plant-based dairy products, like almond milk and soy yogurt, are fortified with just as much calcium as cow milk-based dairy products. There are many cultures that don't traditionally consume dairy products and still have healthy bones, like Japan.</p>

              <h2 style="text-align:left; color:white">Isn't plant-based meat too expensive?</h2>
              <p style="text-align:left; color:white">The cheapest protein sources are plant-based– lentils, tofu, beans. If you think about it, most traditional diets worldwide are predominantly vegetarian or vegan. While some of the specialty products, like coconut ice cream, are expensive, it's easy to be vegan on a very low budget, especially if you can cook for yourself. There's a blog called <a href="https://plantbasedonabudget.com/category/blog/" target="_blank" style="color:white">plant-based on a budget</a>, where they post recipes that can feed a person for $25 per week, or just over $1/meal.</p>
